For all supported models, we generate samples defined by:\n","\n","* expiry, strike, forward rate\n","* lognormal vol level: order of magnitude in lognormal terms for easy intuition. This will be transformed into a model parameter in a model-dependent way. For instance it will be transformed into the parameter $\\alpha$ for SABR.\n","* other model parameters (say $\\beta, \\nu, rho$ for SABR)\n","* option price (put): calculated with the closed-form for Hagan SABR, or by Monte-Carlo simulation for the other models i.e. No-Arbitrage SABR, Free-Boundary SABR, ZABR and Heston.\n","\n","We start by randomly generating expiry, strike, forward rate and other parameters over a user-specified range. For each sample we then calculate the option price. Finally we go through a process of data cleansing which, at the moment, simply consists in calculating the normal volatilities and rejecting numbers judged too high and too low. We then output the cleansed data to a tsv file.\n","\n","As the quality of the data is crucial for the subsequent training, it would be interesting to consider more sophisticated approaches for filtering out bad data, together with of course more efficient valuation methods such as PDEs. The current version of this code, running on a 2018 i5 CPU, takes about 10 hours to generate 100k samples for MC based models."],"metadata":{"id":"nbUPFzrDMbUA"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#
