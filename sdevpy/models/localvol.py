########## ToDo (calibration) #################################################
# * Implement implied vol design, parametric time SVI, piecewise time SVI
# * Use seaborn to represent diffs between IV and LV prices on quoted pillars
# * Add 1d solving to ATM only, to do live and Vega with smile solving less often.
# * For each LV parametric form, record two sets of parameters: those against
#   moneyness and those against strike, to achieve both stickiness.
# * During the warmup in the time direction, we can allocate
#   on each time slice a local vol functional form that is only a function
#   of the spot. This would be a generalized version of the storage
#   of the time interpolation indices for an interpolated surface.
# * A spot parametric local vol would be spot-parametric on predefined
#   time slices, and would for instance take the same parametric form
#   over forward time intervals.
# * We could resolve forward by taking the previous parametric form as
#   starting point.
# * We could use SVI as base and if not enough point, fit only to reduced
#   set of free parameters, the other ones defaulting to good solver starting points.
# * For the (backward) pricing PDE, also allow the standard case of a fully interpolated
#   matrix, using cubic splines with flat extrapolation on both ends and arriving flat
#   first derivative.
# * The choice of time grid during calibration may be guided by the location of the
#   calibration dates. We could decide a certain number of time steps being between
#   each market date, with a certain minimum number especially on the first interval.
# * To check the quality of the calibration, start by comparing against same forward
#   PDE as used in calibration, and then check against backward PDE.
